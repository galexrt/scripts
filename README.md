# scripts

A place for scripts, programs and / or tools, I have collected / written / used over the "years".

## Note

Please note that this repository definitely contains some scripts / programs / tools which I have not written but have no clue anymore who the original author / license holder is.
Should you be the original author / license holder of a script / program / tool in this repository, please reach out to me so I can remove it and / or add the appropriate license to the file(s). Thanks!
